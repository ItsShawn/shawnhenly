# Shawn Henly – CS-499 ePortfolio

Welcome to my professional ePortfolio for the CS-499 Computer Science course at Southern New Hampshire University. This repository showcases my enhanced software artifacts, project documentation, and reflections aligned with industry standards and program outcomes.

## 🛠️ Enhancement One – Software Design and Engineering

**Artifact Title:** `AppointmentService.java`  
**Course Origin:** CS-320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance  
**Enhancement Focus:** Interface-driven architecture, error handling, logging, and SOLID design principles

### 🔍 Overview

The original artifact was a single Java class responsible for managing appointment and contact records using in-memory HashMaps. It included basic methods to create, delete, and retrieve these records, but lacked modularity, validation, and error handling.

### ✨ Enhancement Summary

The enhanced version of this class reflects my progression toward professional software development standards. It introduces meaningful improvements such as:

- ✅ Refactored logic into two clean interfaces: `IAppointmentService` and `IContactService`
- ✅ Introduced `AppointmentException`, a custom runtime exception for better error signaling
- ✅ Integrated **SLF4J** with **Logback** for structured logging
- ✅ Added null checks and duplicate entry protection for input validation
- ✅ Applied **SOLID** principles to improve maintainability and extensibility
